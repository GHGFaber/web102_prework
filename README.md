## Notes

I sadly just joined at the near end before the deadline, but I have had a small amount of experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from my previous semester. I did have some issues trying to implement the .sort function for the filter that I had made. It went from just wanting to sort the cards, to having to further see its implications. At one point, I had to click it twice just to have it properly resort. I guess this challenge made me realize that there are multiple facets when it comes to web development and there is a lot that goes into building one.
